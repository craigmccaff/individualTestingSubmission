# Individual Testing Submission:

This project takes in data from a CSV file which contains a fictional football league table. This data includes: Team, Position, Games Played, Wins, Draws, Losses, Goals Scored, Goals Conceded.
This data is read into the project and filtered via a user input on Team Name. From there the data is manipulated to calculate a points total (3 points for a win, 1 for a draw) and calculate goal difference. The end statistics are then formatted and printed to the screen.
